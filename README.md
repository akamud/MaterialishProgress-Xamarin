# MaterialishProgress-Xamarin
Xamarin bindings for [materialish-progress](https://github.com/pnikosis/materialish-progress) by [@pnikosis](https://github.com/pnikosis)

A material style progress wheel compatible with 2.3

This project keeps a consistent look in an app across all Android Versions. The progress wheel is quite cool in Lollipop, and pretty horrible on Gingerbread.

This view uses [Progress Wheel](https://github.com/Todd-Davies/ProgressWheel) as a base, but has been almost completely rewritten (the original view uses handlers for updating the wheel).

This implementation tries to follow as close as possible the guidelines for the circular progress as [described here](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/progress-activity.html#progress-activity-types-of-indicators).
